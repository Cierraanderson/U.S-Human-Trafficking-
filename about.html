<div class="addressing"><h4>The Focus</h4></div>
<p>This Platform focuses on addressing Human Trafficking Across America. </p>
  <p>According to the Department of Justice, human trafficking is the illegal activity 
  of forcing an individual to perform commercial sex acts or provide labor or other forms of service.</p>
  <p>There can be covert or obvious, physical or psychological coercion. Whether or not coercion, fraud, or force were used, 
  exploiting a minor for commercial sex is still considered human trafficking.</p>
